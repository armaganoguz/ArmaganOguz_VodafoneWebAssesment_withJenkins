# ArmaganOguz_VodafoneWebAssesment_withJenkins
This project includes Jenkins

I developed this project using Selenium Cucumber BDD and in Java language. 
When the test is run, it asks you which browser you want to test from, receiving an input from you. 
It was made using version 104.0.5112.102 for Chrome, version 103.0.2 for Firefox, version 104.0.1293.63 for Microsoft Edge and it can run fine in these versions. 
If the test is run again after running once, it will get an error in the signup part and stop running because the parameter in signup.feature needs to be changed with a new e-mail. 
After the test is run, the htmlReport, jsonReport and junitReport files at /target are updated and generate 3 reports about the test run. 
This work is available in my GitHub account as 2 different public repository. 
I did it by creating a Jenkins server on my localhost in the repository named ArmaganOguz_VodafoneWebAssesment_withJenkins. 
When the project is uploaded to the IDE, it gives many errors in the TestRunner.java file, but it runs. 
I learned very little about Jenkins in this short period of time. 
The second repository, ArmaganOguz_VodafoneWebAssesment, does not have Jenkins, it can be executed successfully.
